Book Allocation & Painter Partitions : min to max; 
Note: 

You want to minimize the maximum pages/time that a student/painter has to handle.

📚 Students or painters are lazy. You want the hardest load (biggest page/time chunk) to be as small as possible.

So you check:

“Can I give books (or boards) to students (or painters) such that no one gets more than mid pages/time?”

✅ If yes, try a smaller max → maybe we can reduce the load
end = mid - 1

❌ If no, mid is too small → increase it
st = mid + 1

Condition you're testing in isValid:
➡️ Can I allocate such that maximum pages/time ≤ mid?

✔️ Goal: minimize maximum pages/time


✅ Aggressive Cows
You want to maximize the minimum distance between cows.

🐄 Cows don’t like to be close. You want them to be as far apart as possible.

So you check:

“Is it possible to place all cows such that each cow is at least mid units away from the previous one?”

✅ If yes, try a larger distance → maybe we can increase the minimum even more
st = mid + 1

❌ If no, distance too large → reduce it
end = mid - 1

Condition you're testing in isValid:
➡️ Can I place cows with distance >= mid?

✔️ Goal: maximize minimum distance



🧠 Core Difference Recap
Problem	Goal	We want to...	Condition to check
Aggressive Cows	Maximize minimum distance	Try larger if valid	distance >= mid
Book/Painter	Minimize maximum pages/time	Try smaller if valid	pages/time ≤ mid



🔁 Quick Analogy:
Cows: “Can we increase our personal space?”
→ Let’s try more space (if possible)

Books/Painters: “Can we reduce our work?”
→ Let’s try less workload (if possible)
