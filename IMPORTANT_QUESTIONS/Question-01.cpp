// //ðŸ“˜ Book Allocation Problem
// You are given N books, where each i-th book has A[i] number of pages.

// You have to allocate books to M students such that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimized.

// Conditions:
// Each book should be allocated to only one student.

// Each student must get at least one book.

// Allocation of books must be contiguous (i.e., a student cannot get book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2).

// Task:
// Calculate and return the minimum possible value of the maximum number of pages allocated to a student.

// Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.

// Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

    cout << allocatedBook(arr, m, n) << " ";
}


//logic behind 
// If you have 5 students and only 3 books, itâ€™s impossible to give at least one book to each student â†’ invalid.

// But if you have 3 students and 5 books, itâ€™s fine some students will get more than one book.

// we need to find minimum book in maximise books
